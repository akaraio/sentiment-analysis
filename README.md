This code trains a sequence classification model using the Hugging Face Transformers library to classify text into one of several predefined categories. The model is trained on a dataset with 30% test data and 10% validation data, and uses the accuracy metric as the evaluation metric. After training the model, the code tests its performance on the test set and generates a classification report and confusion matrix, and also demonstrates how to use the saved model for making predictions on new text inputs.
